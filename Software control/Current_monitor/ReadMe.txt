This folder basically contains the receving part of code (matlab file) and the sending part (Arduino file).
While the arduino is constantly reading voltages from analog pins and send current values every 0.5 seconds 
(changable), the matlab is listening at the same time and refreshing a bar graph visualizing current values.
