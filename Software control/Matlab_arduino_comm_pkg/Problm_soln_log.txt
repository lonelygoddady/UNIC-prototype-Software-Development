************Problems encounter in matlab/arduino Serial connection and solutions**************

1. Serial connection building delay. 

Cause:
While matlab wants to build up the connection with arduino by saying 'open(serial_object)', the conection is not built instantnously. Nevertheless, it rathers takes arduino at least 1.0 second to set up the connection and get ready for incoming data.

Effect:
If data is sent before arduino gets ready, arduino won't get ANYTHING, even though everything seems to be okay and no error message is displayed. 

Solution:
DO NOT send data right after building up serial connection at matlab side. It needs to wait for at least 1.0 second. At the code level, this is saying: put 'pause(t)' (t>1) right after 'fopen(serial_object)'. So matlab will wait for at least 1 second to send its data.

Note: This may not be a universal phenonmenon for all arduino board as I did not see anyone else had this problem online. The wait time may vary board to board.        

2. Signed interger overflow

Cause:
The max decimal number a signed 16-bit type integer can represent is 2^15 - 1, which is 32767, which may causes overflow when we send data larger this value.

Effect:
All voltage values after convert to binary notation, if larger than the max of signed 16 bit value, matlab will send the max number which is 32767 to the arduino.

Solution:
Defined all voltage data matrix to be unsigned type (max is 2^16-1). 

3. Arduino serial reading byte limit 

Cause: 
The arduino function used to capture data sent through serial port, 'Serial.read()' can only read 4 bytes a time - one char a time. However, we need 16 bit, which is 2 bytes to reprensent the voltage value. And matlab sends 2 bytes to the arduino each time.

Effect:
Arduino will just save random/incorrect value because the format does not match.

Solution:
We need to tell arduino to read two bytes a time by following code:
if(Serial.available()>=2) //if the buffer received at least two bytes (16-bit int)
  {

     unsigned int dumy = 0; //local variable to hold the received data temperally 
     dumy = Serial.read(); //dumy hold the lower 8-bits of the data bcs Serial.read() only reads in 8 bits a time 
     data_receive[i] = (Serial.read()<<8)|dumy;//matlab send the first 8 bit first and then the last 8 bit
  }
